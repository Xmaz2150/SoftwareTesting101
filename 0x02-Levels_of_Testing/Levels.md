# Levels of testing?
The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) 
describes an organized strategy to ensuring software quality across multiple levels of testing.
Each stage of testing, beginning with Unit Testing and progressing through Integration Testing,
System Testing, and Acceptance Testing,each level addresses specific aspects of software functionality and
readiness for deployment. These stages, conducted systematically, ensure comprehensive quality assurance before
software release.

# Levels Summary
**Level**|Description|Process|Purpose|
-----|-----------|-------|--------|
**Unit** |Individual components or units of code are tested in isolation. Validates that each unit functions correctly as per the design specifications|Test cases are written and executed by Developers| Identify defects early in the development process
**Integration** |Verifies the interactions and interfaces between integrated units or modules of the software|Integration tests are designed to validate the flow of data and control between interconnected units.|Identifies defects related to the integration of components(interface mismatches)
**System** |Evaluates the behavior of the entire software as a whole|Functional and non-functional aspects of the software are tested, mainly functionality, performance, reliability, usability, security, and compatibility.|Ensures that the software meets quality standards and performs as expected before deployment.
**Acceptance** |Validates whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and satisfies the business/user requirements|Users or stakeholders executing test cases to validate the software against real-world scenarios|Ensures that the software meets user expectations and business needs
