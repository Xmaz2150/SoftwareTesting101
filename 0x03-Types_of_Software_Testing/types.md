Software testing is a layered approach where [testing levels](https://github.com/Xmaz2150/SoftwareTesting101/blob/main/0x02-Levels_of_Testing/Levels.md) define the scope of what's being examined, while testing types (functional, non-functional, [white-box](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing), [black-box](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing)) focus on specific quality aspects. Testing types like functional testing can be applied at any level, while some levels might emphasize specific types (e.g., white-box testing in unit testing).

**Functional**
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing
- Regression testing
- Sanity testing
- Smoke testing

**Non-Functional**
- Performance testing
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Volume testing
- Scalability testing
- Recovery testing
- Compatibly testing
- Security testing
