# Black-box techniques

1. **Equivalence Partitioning**: The Equivalence Partitioning Method, commonly known as Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP), is a black-box testing technique that divides input domains into data classes to generate test cases.
It evaluates equivalence classes for given input conditions, effectively identifying mistake classes and eliminating the requirement for a large number of unnecessary test cases.
The guidelines for Equivalence Partitioning include defining valid and invalid equivalence classes based on input conditions like range, particular values, set members, or Boolean values.

2. **Boundary Value Analysis**: Focuses on testing boundary values of valid and invalid partitions, as they are more likely to reveal defects.
BVA tests input values at their boundaries, such as minimum, just above minimum, nominal, just below maximum, and maximum values for each variable to write better test cases.

3. **Decision Table**: A collection of rules that describe decision scenarios in which the state of a number of circumstances dictates the execution of a sequence of actions.

4. **State Transtion Testing**: A powerful technique for ensuring software stability. It focuses on how the software behaves as it transitions between different states.
By identifying these states and the events that trigger transitions between them, test cases are designed that explore potential issues.
This helps uncover bugs that might arise during state changes and ensures the software operates smoothly under various user interactions.
This technique is particularly valuable for systems with well-defined states and clear triggers for transitions.
