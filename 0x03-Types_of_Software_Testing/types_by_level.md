# Black-box vs White-box Testing

Black Box Testing is a type of software testing in which the tester has no knowledge of the software's internal
structure, design, or implementation. Only the outward design and construction are evaluated. On the other hand 
White Box Testing is a software testing method in which the tester is aware of the thing being tested's internal structure,
design, and implementation. The implementation and impact of the code are evaluated.

## Key Differences
|White-box|Black-box|
|--|--|
|Code implementation/Knowledge is necessary|Implementation/Knowledge of code is not needed|
|By developers|By testers|
|Logic testing|Behavior testing|
|Time intensive|Least time|
|Functional (Path Testing, Loop Testing, Condition testing)|Functional & Non-Functional(Regression Testing, Performance Testing, Usability Testing|

## Design techniques

### Black-box:
- Equivalence partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Decision table testing
- State Transtion Testing
- Error guessing

### White-box:
- Statement Coverage
- Branch Coverage
- Path Coverage
