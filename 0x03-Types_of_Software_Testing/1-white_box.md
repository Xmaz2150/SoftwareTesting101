# White-box techniques
1. **Statement Coverage**: Guarantees the execution of every executable statement within the source code, at least once. This technique helps testers locate untested parts of code and ensures a minimal degree of code coverage.
2. **Branch Coverage**: Measures the percentage of executed branches or decision points in code, such as if statements or loops. It specifies whether tests look at both the true and false branches of conditional statements.
3. **Path Coverage**: This technique involves executing all possible paths in the code. It's more comprehensive than statement and branch coverage, but it can be complex for large codebases due to the high number of possible paths.
