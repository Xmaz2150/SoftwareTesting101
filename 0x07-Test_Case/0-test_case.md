# Test Case?
Serves as a blueprint for verifying a specific aspect of the software's behavior, it's essentially
a set of instructions that tells the tester what to do, what data to use, and what results to expect 
to ensure a particular feature of the software functions correctly.

## Elements of a Test Case
1. **Title**: What you are trying to test, a piece of functionality of the software.
2. **Description**: Provides a clear and brief explanation of the purpose of the test case.
3. **Prerequisite**: States conditions that need to be met before executing the test steps. This ensures that the test is run in a well-defined environment and prevents unexpected outcomes from missing setups. 
4. **Test Data**: Provides inputs that will enable testing of the feature or functionality.
5. **Test Steps**: Defines sequence of actions the tester needs to perform to execute the test.
6. **Expected Result**: Goes hand in hand with each step(in Test Steps) by stating the expected outcome or behavior of the software after executing the test step(s).

# Why is it important?
Tracebility, reusability, requirement coverage
