# Test Case?
Serves as a blueprint for verifying a specific aspect of the software's behavior, it's essentially
a set of instructions that tells the tester what to do, what data to use, and what results to expect 
to ensure a particular feature of the software functions correctly.

## Elements of a Test Case
1. **Title**: What you are trying to test, a piece of functionality of the software.
2. **Description**: Provides a clear and brief explanation of the purpose of the test case.
3. **Prerequisite**: States conditions that need to be met before executing the test steps. This ensures that the test is run in a well-defined environment and prevents unexpected outcomes from missing setups. 
4. **Test Data**: Provides inputs that will enable testing of the feature or functionality.
5. **Test Steps**: Defines sequence of actions the tester needs to perform to execute the test.
6. **Expected Result**: Goes hand in hand with each step(in Test Steps) by stating the expected outcome or behavior of the software after executing the test step(s).

# Why is it important?
Well written test cases enable effective software testing. They ensure traceability by linking requirements to tests and defects, promote reusability by enabling adaptation for similar functionalities, and guarantee thorough testing by tracking coverage of all software requirements.
