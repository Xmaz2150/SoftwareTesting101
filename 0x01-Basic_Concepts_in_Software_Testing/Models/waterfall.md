# Waterfall model

A linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle ([SDLC](https://medium.com/@muzirat0/the-software-development-life-cycle-4a833102fd0c)),
is widely used in software engineering and product development.

## Pros ✔️
- **Clear Structure**: Provides a clear and understandable
  approach with distinct phases for project planning and management.
- **Timeline**: Its linear nature allows for generally precise estimates of project
   timeframes and prices, which aids in planning and budgeting.

## Cons ✖️
- **Late Testing**: Testing is often done later in the process, which increases the possibility of late problem
 detection and potentially greater repair costs.
- **Limited Flexibility**: The model's tight sequential structure makes it difficult to adapt changes
 in requirements or unexpected challenges, which could result in project delays or increased costs.
- **Limited Customer Involvement**: Customers may disconnected from the development process until later phases,
 resulting in misunderstandings or dissatisfaction with the finished product.
