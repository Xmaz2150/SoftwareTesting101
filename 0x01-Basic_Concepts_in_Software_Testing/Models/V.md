# V model?
The V-model is a software development lifecycle ([SDLC](https://medium.com/@muzirat0/the-software-development-life-cycle-4a833102fd0c)) that connects each step of development to its corresponding testing phase. It is named after its V-shaped graphical representation,
which shows development on the left and testing on the right. Each development phase corresponds to a testing phase.

## Pros ✔️
- **Clear Structure**: Phases and testing are well-defined.
- **Early Defect Detection**: Testing at each phase catches defects early.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensures thorough validation of software.
- **Validation Emphasis**: Ensures final product meets requirements.
- **Traceability**: Facilitates tracking and management of progress.

## Cons ✖️
- **Rigidity**: Sequential nature may not suit all projects.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Changes can be costly and challenging.
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires significant time and effort.
