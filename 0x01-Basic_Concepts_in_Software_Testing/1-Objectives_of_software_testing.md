# Objectives of software testing

1. Finding and Preventing Bugs:
Detecting and eliminating software flaws (bugs) before they reach users. Testing login functionality may reveal an issue in which a strong password is not accepted. This would be a bug that needed to be fixed.

2. Aligning with the requirements:
Ensuring that the software meets all documented requirements, both functional and non-functional. A requirement could specify a search feature that returns results within 2 seconds. Testing ensures that the performance benchmark is met.

3. Developing High-Quality Software:
Create a polished product by combining rigorous testing with a focus on user experience (UX). Usability testing may reveal an unclear menu layout. This would prompt improvements to create a more intuitive user experience.

4. Ensuring Fitness for Use:
Ensuring that the software is appropriate for its intended purpose and can be used effectively by the target audience. Testing an e-commerce platform may include simulating real-world user workflows to ensure a smooth purchase experience.
