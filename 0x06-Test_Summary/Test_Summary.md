# Test Summary?
The completion of a piece of software shifts responsibilities to testers for quality assurance. Larger projects, such as those
found in corporations or startups, require thorough testing, rendering verbal communication impossible. To solve this, a
standardized test summary report is proposed to provide critical technical insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders,
hence improving communication and understanding across the SDLC cycle.

## A Test Summary skeleton:
1. **Objectives**: States the objectives and goals of the testing phase.
2. **Application Overview**: Provides an overview of software being tested mainly it's features.
3. **Testing Scope**: determines the scope of the test cases or suites that were run during the testing phase. The scope is broken
 into two parts: in-scope and out-scope, which specify the areas that were within and outside of the scope of the suites, respectively.
 This helps to provide a more complete picture of what the test summary report is about.
4. **Test Approach**: Documents the test approach listing methodologies used like black box and white box testing.
5. **Test Envirnment details**: Specify the hardware, software, and configurations used for testing.
6. **Testing Metrics**: Presents metrics such as the number of tests planned vs executed, and the pass/fail status of tests.
7. **Defects Summary**: Provides a summary of all defects identified during testing, including the total number and any outstanding defects.
8. **Overall Summary**: Summarize the testing process, highlighting key findings, successes, and areas for improvement.
