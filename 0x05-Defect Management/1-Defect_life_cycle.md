# Defect LifeCycle?
 
The Defect life cycle refers to the process of identifying, reporting,
analyzing, fixing, verifying, and closing software defects or issues. It
is an important part of software development since it ensures that the
finished product is of good quality and satisfies customer expectations.
The defect life cycle allows software teams to systematically manage defects
and enhance their entire development process by providing insights into the
root cause of problems and helping in the prevention of future
recurrence of the same defects.

## Defect States and Resolution
![Defect LifeCycle model](https://github.com/Xmaz2150/img/blob/main/Defect_LifeCycle.png)

1. **New**: User, tester, or developer discovers a bug during or after the software's release.
2. **Deferred**: The bug has been postponed or delayed for whatever reason. This could happen if the bug is not regarded serious enough to fix right away, or if the necessary resources are not available to handle the problem.
3. **Assign**: The bug is assigned to a developer who is responsible for fixing it.
4. **Open**: Developer reviews and validates the bug report, confirming that it is a legitimate issue.
5. **Rejected**: The bug report is rejected for a variety of reasons, including not being reproducible or not being a legitimate issue.
6. **Fixed**: The development team identifies the status as "Fixed" whenever appropriate code modifications have been made or after a bug has been fixed.
7. **Retest**: At this point, the tester begins the process of retesting the defect to see whether or not the developer has fixed it, and the state is marked as 'Retesting'.
8. **Reopen**: The bug was discovered to still exist after it had been marked as fixed. It may need further inquiry or a new solution.
9. **Reassign**: The defect is sent for fixing again.
10. **Closed**: The bug report is closed, and the software is released with the bug patch.
