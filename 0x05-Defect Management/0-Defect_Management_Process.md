# Defect Management Process

 Defect management is a process in software development and quality assurance that involves identifying, reporting, prioritizing, tracking, and resolving software faults. It helps to maintain and improve the overall quality of a software product. Defect management is an iterative process that occurs throughout the development lifecycle to ensure that the software is of good quality and meets the user's needs.

## Defect ?

A deviation from the expected output of a test case/scenario.

 ## Defect Metrics
 
 1. **Critical Defect Percentage**: Focuses on the severity of defects. It determines the percentage of all identified defects that are rated as critical.  Critical defects have a significant influence on the software's functioning, stability, or security.  A high critical defect percentage suggests possible flaws in the development or testing processes, implying the need to identify and resolve significant issues sooner.

2. **Defect Rejection Ratio**: Measures issues that were raised that ultimately had no impact on product quality.  This could easily be considered a measure of wasted effort and an opportunity for improvement.

3. **Defect Leakage Ratio**: Measures how well defects are identified before the software is released to production.  A high defect leakage ratio suggests that testing might be inadequate or there could be gaps between development and testing phases, allowing defects to slip through. Again also show nother opportunity for improvement.

These metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the software development and testing processes, specifically related to defect identification, resolution, and prevention.
