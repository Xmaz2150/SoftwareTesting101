# Defect Severity & Priority
![](https://github.com/Xmaz2150/img/blob/main/DefectSeverity%26Priority.png)
In line with defect management processes, when a tester files a defect, they must provide 
some categorical information that will aid in the classification of the error.
This, in turn, would aid in effective defect tracking/management processes and lay
the groundwork for faster defect turnaround time. The two main categories of effectively
tracking a defect are defect severity and priority.

## Defect Severity
Defect severity refers to the seriousness or impact of a defect on the functionality of the software.
1. **Critical**: Brings the entire system down or causes significant data loss.
2. **Major**: Makes a vital feature unusable or causes considerable performance issues.
3. **Minor**: Affects a secondary function or creates moderate usability concerns.
4. **Low**: Cosmetic flaw that has no influence on functionality.

## Defect Priority
Defect priority, on the other hand, specifies the sequence in which defects should be addressed.
1. **Immediate**: They completely disable fundamental functioning of a system or result in important data loss.  Fixing them is immediate
 and top priority.
2. **High**: These defects may affect the entire software. They require resolution as soon as possible, and setting a high priority
 ensures a short resolution time.
3. **Medium**: Causes moderate problems or affects secondary features. They do not break the system, but they can be frustrating for users. These problems normally handled during the normal development cycle
 and may be rectified in the subsequent release.
4. **Low**: Defects are classified as small inconveniences or cosmetic problems. They have a small influence on functionality and may not be immediately apparent to users. These are
frequently addressed when time permits or incorporated into future versions.
